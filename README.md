# General Algorithms
A variety of algorithm implementations and short classes.

### AdditionTFLearn:
Python code for the machine learning of addition. Uses TFLearn and TensorFlow.

### BinarySearch:
Java/Python code for finding a number using binary search (upper bound and lower bound).

### Knapsack:
Java/Python code for solving the Knapsack problem using recursive memoization.

### Dijkstra:
Python code for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

### PrimMST:
Python code for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Prim's MST algorithm.

### FloydWarshall:
Python code for finding all-pairs shortest path in a graph using Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shortest path algorithm.

### BellmanFord:
Python code for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm.

### UnionFind:
Python implementation of the Union-Find data structure.

### BITree:
Python implementation of the Fenwick Tree or Binary Indexed Tree data structure.

### SegmentTree:
Python implementation of the Segment Tree data structure, with three different variations: range max and single replace, range max and range increment, and range sum and range replace.

### Trie:
Python implementation of the Trie data structure. Contains insert, delete, contains, and find all words with prefix functions.

### KruskalMST:
Python code for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal's MST algorithm.

### KnuthMorrisPratt:
Python implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string matching algorithm.

### TopologicalSort:
Python code for doing a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### BreadthFirstSearch:
Python implementation of breadth first search (BFS), using the built in collections.deque.

### Geometry:
A collection of computational geometry functions (for points, lines, line segments, vectors, and polygons) written in Python. Includes Graham's Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points.
